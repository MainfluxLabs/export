    image: mainflux/influxdb:[version]
    container_name: [instance name]
    expose:
      - [Service HTTP port]
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      MF_NATS_URL: [NATS instance URL]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_LOG_LEVEL: [Influx writer log level]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_PORT: [Service HTTP port]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_NAME: [InfluxDB name]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_HOST: [InfluxDB host]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_PORT: [InfluxDB port]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_USER: [InfluxDB admin user]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_PASS: [InfluxDB admin password]
      MF_INFLUX_WRITER_CHANNELS_CONFIG: [Configuration file path with channels list]
    ports:
      - [host machine port]:[configured HTTP port]
    volume:
      - ./channels.yaml:/config/channels.yaml
```

To start the service, execute the following shell script:

```bash
# download the latest version of the service
go get github.com/mainflux/mainflux


cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mainflux/mainflux

# compile the influxdb
make influxdb

# copy binary to bin
make install

# Set the environment variables and run the service
MF_NATS_URL=[NATS instance URL] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_LOG_LEVEL=[Influx writer log level] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_PORT=[Service HTTP port] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_NAME=[InfluxDB database name] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_HOST=[InfluxDB database host] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_PORT=[InfluxDB database port] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_USER=[InfluxDB admin user] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_DB_PASS=[InfluxDB admin password] MF_INFLUX_WRITER_CHANNELS_CONFIG=[Configuration file path with channels list] $GOBIN/mainflux-influxdb

```

### Using docker-compose

This service can be deployed using docker containers.
Docker compose file is available in `<project_root>/docker/addons/influxdb-writer/docker-compose.yml`. Besides database
and writer service, it contains [Grafana platform](https://grafana.com/) which can be used for database
exploration and data visualization and analytics. In order to run Mainflux InfluxDB writer, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/influxdb-writer/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

_Please note that you need to start core services before the additional ones._

## Usage

Starting service will start consuming normalized messages in SenML format.
